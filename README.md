This repository contains an example of an uncommon code error in assembly language: an out-of-bounds memory access. The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the flawed code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version with proper bounds checking.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management in low-level programming languages.  The error is subtle and can be difficult to detect without thorough testing.
